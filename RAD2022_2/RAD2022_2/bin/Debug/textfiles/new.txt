ΤΣΙΜΑΡΙ… .ΔΙΟΝΙ
In the cool turquoise waters of the Ionian Sea and facing the fantastic sunsets.

With the pies of Kyra-Koula and the piglet of Panagiotis, with the fresh fish of Navagos and the well-cooked tasty mutton and all this in a quiet and peaceful family environment.
Visitors should not leave garbage, because this kilometer beach is cleaned only by volunteers, because there is no care but neither does our Municipal Authority and the so-called Environmentalists. Like everything here in our area they are abandoned and in their fate…
Be careful where you walk if you see the seagulls above you means that you are close to the eggs that have been laid in small puddles…. Do not press them.
Do not forget that you walk and swim on a Historic European beach and above the wreckage of the Turkish Ottoman fleet << La battaglia di Lepanto detta anche battaglia delleEchinadi >> …… George Kalokliros
