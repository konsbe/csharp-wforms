Dioni is a beach in the Ionian Sea, in Katochi and on the north side of the Acheloos estuary.

To get there you travel a distance from the plain about 16 kilometers from the village. You pass through the plain of the Occupation and Oiniades, (the ancient state on the hill, which in those years was an island and belonged to the Echinades islands).
The area offers stunning sunsets and views of the Ionian Islands. It is part of the famous ecosystem of the area. The beach is sandy and shallow.
